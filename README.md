# Mocking Automation

This is a mocking automation program designed to automate endpoint testing programs. It provides a convenient way to simulate responses from APIs and test the behavior of client applications.

## Python Library

The mocking automation program includes a Python library that allows you to quickly create scripts for mocking endpoints. With this library, you can easily define the expected responses and behaviors of the mocked endpoints.

To use the Python library, you can import it into your Python script and start defining the mock endpoints.

## C++ 

In addition to the Python library, the mocking automation program provides a C++ integration for seamless development integration. This allows developers working on projects in C++ to easily incorporate endpoint mocking into their testing processes.
